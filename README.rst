SimpleBase is a JSON based serverless database with improved performance on key operations

The strength of document-oriented NoSQL DBMS is their natural simplicity, but they are usually not very fast (unless they are serious server DBMS like MongoDB). SimpleBase fixes performance issues in critical areas

Instant addition of new records to collections, regardless of the size of the collection due to a special storage architecture
Faster work with operations, due to the fact that it is not required to encode / decode the entire collection (which can be very large)
Collections are always stored in RAM with concurrency change tracking: data is re-read from disk only if it has been changed by another process
ACID for multi-user and multi-threading
Two types of indexes for key types of queries - a hash index and a special B-tree for full-text search
Support for transactions (sessions)
MongoDB-like interface, incl. 100% similar query language
Written in pure python, only about 1800 lines
Why SimpleBase?
It was written for situations where you need to organize a local database without a server with a JSON-oriented interface. But at the same time, increased performance requirements: for large collections (1000000+ documents in the collection), fast, almost instantaneous execution of some operations is required:

Add a new document to the collection with 1000000 documents - 0.007 seconds, with 2000000 documents - also 0.0007 seconds - ie. operation time does not depend on the size of the table
Find an element by equality in a collection with 1000000+ entries in 1-2 microseconds
Organize real-time search by occurrence of a string across a large collection without friezes
Getting started sapmle
from simplebase import SimpleBase,DBSession

#creatig database
db = SimpleBase("samples_db")

#inserting documents into collection
id = db['goods'].insert({"name":"coffee", "price":15}) #insert one document
print(db['goods'].get(id))

inserted = db['goods'].insert([{"name":"apple", "price":2},{"name":"apple", "price":3}]) #insert dataset

#insert or update (upsert)
db['goods'].insert({"name":"coffee", "price":16,"_id":id},upsert=True)
print(db['goods'].get(id))

#transaction
with DBSession(db) as s:
    inserted = db['income'].insert({"product_id":id} , session=s)
    inserted = db['outgoing'].insert({"product_id":id} , session=s)

#updating
db['goods'].update(inserted,{"updated":True})
print(db['goods'].all())

#simple search without index
result = db['goods'].find({"name":"apple"})

#building complex queries
result = db['goods'].find({"$and":[
    {"price":{"$gt":1}},
    {"price":{"$lte":10}}
    ]}
    )
print(result)

#hash indexes for unique values
db['goods'].register_hash_index("hash_dynamic","name", dynamic=True) #there are dynamic and stored indexes
db['goods'].reindex_hash("hash_dynamic")
r = db['goods'].get_by_index(db["hash_dynamic"],"apple")


#text indexes
db['goods'].register_text_index("fts","name", dynamic=True) #there are dynamic and stored indexes
db['goods'].reindex_text("fts")
r = db['goods'].search_text_index("appl")

#delete
db['goods'].delete(id)
db['goods'].delete(inserted)

#clear
db['goods'].clear()
